I am [**Cristishor**](https://github.com/Cristishor201), I am tall as **201** cm, and I like pretty much everything in terms of tehnology.
I liked starting building websites, like my own using ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white), ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white), ![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white), ![jQuery](https://img.shields.io/badge/jquery-%230769AD.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=jquery&logoColor=white), ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) and ![WordPress](https://img.shields.io/badge/WordPress-%23117AC9.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=WordPress&logoColor=white).

I liked use my creativity in ![Adobe Photoshop](https://img.shields.io/badge/adobe%20photoshop-%2331A8FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=adobe%20photoshop&logoColor=white), building images for my website, or just expressing myself.

And I liked also electronics, which is the reason why I started also some projects here on embedded field, like [ESP8266](https://github.com/Cristishor201/ESP8266), [STM32F407g](https://github.com/Cristishor201/STM32F407), and my electronics [blog](https://www.facebook.com/Atelierul-de-Electronica-111277717034607/) out there.

I am also in mechanics, with my [Faculty of Mechanics Engineering](http://www.mecanica.pub.ro/), with some experience and personal projects on 3D design as well, in *[Catia](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1098765766830548&type=3)*, *[AutoCAD](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2785847508122357&type=3)*, *Inventor*, *Solidworks*. 

In other words I like to build and innovate stuff :hammer_and_wrench:.

The quote from the top of the page *"Life is too short to learn everything"* kinda is my state where I got.
That's why I planning to cheat time, diving in automation IT or IoT, and later even in DevOps. I may want to learn also machine learning, if it is what it says it is. (learning in my place ðŸ˜…).
